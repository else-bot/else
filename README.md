# else.bot

else.bot is a personal AI agent that learns to reflect its owner. One main assistant understands your personal, family, and work context, remembers what matters, and delegates tasks to other bots when needed.

You should be able to talk to it without choosing the right bot or repeating your circumstances each time. The assistant learns from daily use and becomes proactive enough to suggest what to do next.

The project is in research and design. No application implementation has started.

The first version is a messaging app for one owner. It should let you talk to multiple bots, create a bot, and delete a bot. Provider continuity and persistent memory support those conversations. Email, projects, notes, routines, mobile apps, and additional desktop views come later. The [research review](docs/research/README.md) records the starting design and verification results.

## Why I want to build it

I like how Grok Bot works. It is easy to use, has many connectors, and lets bots share memories and talk to each other. Its mobile and desktop apps have notifications built in. Talking to a bot and having it do things feels like the right starting point.

But I struggle to use it for everything. I am tied to one provider, which makes moving to another AI provider difficult. I also have to choose between multiple bots instead of talking to one main assistant that knows me and decides who should handle the task.

I also find myself needing separate apps for projects and notes so the bots can use them. I want those tools inside else.bot, alongside email and conversation.

## One assistant across family life and work

For example:

> Remind me to pick up the kids on Friday because my wife works late that day.

else.bot should recognize the family context and create the reminder in the right place. The same assistant should understand your job, companies, and ongoing work, then help decide what to tackle next.

Each bot has its own memory and responsibilities. The main assistant knows which bots exist and can delegate work or retrieve relevant context through their skills.

## The tools belong in the conversation

Messaging is the main entry point. The broader product should add mobile clients, notifications, and views for the things the assistant works with:

- Email, with help organizing messages, creating reminders, and drafting replies.
- Projects and kanban boards for tracking work across multiple projects.
- Notes you can ask bots to write and retrieve later.
- Routines that run on a schedule or respond to events through webhooks.

Each bot also has an isolated computer with Chromium, a desktop, and a terminal. You can open its desktop through VNC. Its files and browser state persist between tasks while idle computers can release system resources.

## Provider choice and ownership

else.bot should work with AI providers through CLIs installed on the host and your existing subscriptions. Bots operate their isolated computers through scoped tools when a task needs them. You can switch providers during a task while keeping one conversation and handing over the context needed to continue.

The assistant runs on a server or dedicated hardware at home. Its memory, configuration, conversations, and bot computers belong to the owner. Encrypted backups should let you restore the assistant on a new machine and resume from the latest completed backup.

## Design notes

The detailed notes separate requirements, decisions, proposals, and research results. Experiments and validation work are marked where they remain incomplete.
